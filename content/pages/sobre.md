Hi there 👋

I'm Marcio, from Brazil 💚

- 🔭 I’m currently working at Philips Clinical Informatics
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Full Stack Web Development

📫 Where to find me

I am graduated in information systems and post graduated in IT governance.

My main IT experience was during the period from June 2010 to April 2020 at a logistics and e-commerce company. It was an on-premise ERP where my responsibility as a Systems Analyst was to maintain the organization's financial systems (accounts payable and accounts receivable), performing analysis, requirements gathering and developing solutions using Delphi and Oracle.

In my opinion, a good IT professional needs to: adapt, always be in constant evolution and leave the comfort zone. I am always looking for improvement and learning new technologies and programming languages.

My professional goal is to work in a reference company in the market, which uses current and emerging technologies. With motivated and collaborative people, developing products and services that make a difference in the market and in people's lives.
